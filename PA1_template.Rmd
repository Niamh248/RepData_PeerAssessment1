## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r unzip, cache = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
unzip("activity.zip",exdir = "data")

```

```{r reading, cache = TRUE}

activity <- read.csv("data/activity.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(activity)
summary(activity)
```


##pulling data without nas
```{r}
activity$day <- weekdays(as.Date(activity$date))
activity$DateTime<- as.POSIXct(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

##pulling data without nas
clean <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]
head(activity$date)
head(activity$day)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
